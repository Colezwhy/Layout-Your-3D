Given a text prompt describing multiple objects and their 2D spatial relationships, our method generates a 3D scene depicting these objects naturally interacting with one another. Also, Layout-Your-3D supports instance-wise attributes editing and customization, which opens up new possibilities for compositional 3D generation.
